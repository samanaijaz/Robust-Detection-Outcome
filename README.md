# Robust-Detection-Outcome
I went through a research paper,
"Robust Detection Outcome: A Metric for Pathology Detection in Medical Images,"
by Felix Meissen, Philip Muller, Georgios Kaissis, and Daniel Rueckert, 
and found it really fascinating how the algorithm used allows for better evaluation of pathology detection and clinical uses.
It will be most useful with Chest X-rays.

Sharing the code so that everyone can benefit from it.
